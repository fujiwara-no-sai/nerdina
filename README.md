<h1>Nerdina Entertainment Monthly Report</h1>

<h2>Raw Data & Analysis Objective</h2>
<hr>
<p>There is a company called Nerdina Entertainment (Nerdina for short). It's been decided to optimize the operation costs of 4 departments (see below). These have 4 types of specialists on staff. Each of the 4 types is characterized by three base properties: pay rate per month, gallons of coffee consumed per month and (just for the fun of it) the amount of code units (whatever this means) produced per month. Additionally, Nerdina employs a system of grades: each employee is assigned a grade that affects their monthly payrate. The chief of a department is a special status that alters all of the base stats. The summary of the available data is in the next sections.</p>
  
<p>The preliminary goal is to produce a report like this:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>DEPARTMENT</th>
    <th>STAFF</th>
    <th>LABOR COST</th>
    <th>COFFEE DRUNK</th>
    <th>CODE UNITS</th>
    <th>COST PER UNIT</th>
